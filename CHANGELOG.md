# Changelog

## Unreleased
- Vehicle model: added low-poly parametric mesh aligned to footprint dimensions.
- Top/Side editing: added toggle to enable 2D projection dragging (XY for Top, XZ for Side).
- Scenario overlays: pedestrian crossing and intersection paths with coverage indicators.
- LiDAR point cloud: deterministic seeded point cloud using Three.js Points.
- Coverage metrics: ground-plane sampling with per-type and combined coverage% plus optional heatmap.
- Performance safeguards: performance mode reduces LiDAR point count, coverage samples, and aux view update frequency.
