# Vehicle Reference (Tesla-Inspired)

This project uses a low-poly, Tesla-referenced body profile to make the vehicle shape recognizable while keeping performance stable.

## Reference Basis
- Tesla Model 3 / Model Y external dimensions (publicly available specs).
- Approximate body proportions:
  - Length-to-height ratio targets sedan/suv silhouettes.
  - Roofline slope and rear taper modeled for Tesla-style fastback.

## Implementation Notes
- Geometry is procedural (no assets) for GitHub Pages compatibility.
- Body uses an extruded profile with beveling to suggest curved surfaces.
- Wheels, mirrors, and glass are added at high detail only.
- Detail level is toggleable (high/low) for performance on mobile.

## Sources (Public Specs)
